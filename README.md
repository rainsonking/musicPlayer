- Provides rich API methods to easily implement various functions.
- In one sentence, you can customize the notification bar and the system notification bar to customize the control of the notification bar.
- Integrated MediaPlayer and ExoPlayer Players, Freely Switchable
- Supports multiple audio formats and supports audio streaming(DASH, SmoothStreaming, HLS，rtmp.).
- Supports the playback progress
- Supports Cache while playing，no network can play.

## Version update record

See details [Version update record](https://github.com/lizixian18/MusicLibrary/blob/master/readme/version.md)

## project status

The project is basically stable and has been practically used in a number of commercial projects. The current status is to repair the bugs found and to satisfy the requirements raised in the issues. If you encounter any problems in use, welcome feedback.

## Demo

Specific application Demo Please refer to [NiceMusic](https://github.com/lizixian18/NiceMusic)

## Usage

1.Import library

```java
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven{url 'https://dl.bintray.com/lizixian/MusicLibrary'}
    }
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'com.lzx:MusicLibrary:x.y.z'
}
```
Please replace x and y and z with the latest version numbers


If your appcompat-v7 package is using 27+, then you need an extra reference to support-media-compat. For example:

```java
implementation 'com.android.support:support-media-compat:27.1.1'
```

If you find that you still can't find the related class's crash after the reference, please check if the same package exists but the version is different and cause conflict.

2. add MusicLibrary to your Application

```java
public class NiceMusicApplication extends Application {

    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        if (BaseUtil.getCurProcessName(this).equals("your package name")) {
            MusicLibrary musicLibrary = new MusicLibrary.Builder(this)
                              .build();
            musicLibrary.startMusicService();
        }
    }
}
```

**note**
1. Because the music service is running in the musicLibrary process, in the multi-process case, Application will create multiple times, so you need to add the above judgment in the initialization, initialized in your main process.
2. There are some parameters that can be configured during initialization:

- setAutoPlayNext(boolean autoPlayNext) Whether to play the next song automatically after playing the current song
- setUseMediaPlayer(boolean isUseMediaPlayer) Whether to use MediaPlayer
- setNotificationCreater(NotificationCreater creater) Notification bar configuration
- setCacheConfig(cacheConfig) Cache when playing configuration
- giveUpAudioFocusManager() Give up audio focus management, after give up, multiple audio will be mixed together

for example：

```java
//Notification configuration
NotificationCreater creater = new NotificationCreater.Builder()
        .setTargetClass("com.lzx.nicemusic.module.main.HomeActivity")
        .setCreateSystemNotification(true)
        .setNotificationCanClearBySystemBtn(true)
        .setSystemNotificationShowTime(true)
        .setPendingIntentMode(PendingIntentMode.MODE_ACTIVITY)
        .build();

//边播边存配置
CacheConfig cacheConfig = new CacheConfig.Builder()
        .setOpenCacheWhenPlaying(true)
        .setCachePath(CacheUtils.getStorageDirectoryPath() + "/NiceMusic/Cache/")
        .build();

MusicLibrary musicLibrary = new MusicLibrary.Builder(this)
        .setNotificationCreater(creater)
        .setCacheConfig(cacheConfig)
        .setUseMediaPlayer(false)
        .build();
musicLibrary.startMusicService();
```

3. Configuration AndroidManifest.xml

In order to allow the user to decide whether to open the multi-process to use the library, the configuration of the manifest file is given to the user, as follows:


```xml
<!--MusicService-->
<service
    android:name="com.lzx.musiclibrary.MusicService"
    android:exported="true"
    android:process=":MusicLibrary" />
<!--Wire control related-->
<receiver
    android:name="com.lzx.musiclibrary.receiver.RemoteControlReceiver"
    android:exported="true"
    android:process=":MusicLibrary">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.MEDIA_BUTTON" />
    </intent-filter>
</receiver>
<!--Notification bar event related-->
<receiver
    android:name="com.lzx.musiclibrary.receiver.PlayerReceiver"
    android:exported="true"
    android:process=":MusicLibrary">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="com.lzx.nicemusic.close" />
        <action android:name="com.lzx.nicemusic.play_pause" />
        <action android:name="com.lzx.nicemusic.prev" />
        <action android:name="com.lzx.nicemusic.next" />
    </intent-filter>
</receiver>
```
The default is to use multi-process, if you do not want to use, remove android:process=":MusicLibrary", where MusicLibrary is the name of the process, you can define it yourself.


**other instructions**
If you use the System.exit(0); method to exit the APP, you may need to call the ActivityManager#killBackgroundProcesses method again.
Kill the audio process, otherwise it may report a crash, so try not to do it.

3. Simple to use (play a song):

```java
SongInfo songInfo = new SongInfo();
songInfo.setSongId("your song Id"); 
songInfo.setSongUrl("your song url"); 

MusicManager.get().playMusicByInfo(songInfo);
```

At least set songId and songUrl to play.To play audio in the local audio or assets folder, or streaming audio such as m3u8, just use set the songUrl and songId as usual.
